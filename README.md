## 📌 Project Overview

**TestNG-Hybrid-DataDriven-Framework** is a robust and scalable **UI automation framework** built with a **hybrid architecture**. It combines **TestNG**, **Page Object Model (POM)**, **Data-Driven Testing (powered by Excel)**, and industry best practices like reusable components, centralized configuration, modular design, and advanced logging/reporting.

Designed for **maintainability**, **reusability**, and **flexibility**, the framework is ideal for testing web applications across browsers and environments with ease.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- ☕ Java 21
- 🌐 Selenium WebDriver
- 🧪 TestNG
- 🔧 Maven
- 📄 Apache POI (Excel-based Data)
- 📊 Extent Reports
- 🪵 Log4j
- 🧪 TestNG Listeners

### 🔨 Implemented Features

> The following core functionalities were **designed and developed from scratch** as part of the framework implementation:

- ✅ **Custom WebDriver Factory** using Singleton Design Pattern for optimal driver instance management.

- 📦 **Page Object Model (POM)** structure with page-wise encapsulation and modular method definitions.

- 🔁 **Reusable Action Layer**  
  Developed a centralized `ElementActions` class to perform all UI operations like clicks, inputs, waits, alert handling, frame switching, and date picker logic.

- 📊 **Excel-based Data-Driven Testing**  
  Integrated Apache POI to fetch test data dynamically using `Map<String, String>` for cleaner, scalable parameterization.

- 🧪 **TestNG-based Test Orchestration**  
  Efficient use of annotations (`@BeforeClass`, `@DataProvider`, `@Test`, `@AfterMethod`) to control test flow and reusability.

- 🔄 **Listeners and Failure Handling**  
  Implemented custom TestNG listeners for test monitoring, with auto-screenshot capture on test failure.

- ⚙️ **Configurable Environment Setup**  
  Externalized configurations like URL, browser, headless mode using a `config.properties` file.

- 🧪 **Suite and Parallel Execution**  
  Enabled test grouping and parallel execution via `testng.xml` for batch and cross-browser runs.

- 🌍 **Cross-Browser & Headless Execution Support**  
  Designed flexible browser configurations for Chrome, Firefox (UI & headless).

- 🪵 **Log4j Logging Integration**  
  Implemented multi-level logging (info, debug, error) for better debugging and traceability.

- 📈 **Integrated Extent Reports**  
  Generated rich HTML test reports with screenshot support on failure and status highlighting.

- ▶️ **One-Click Test Execution**  
  Created a `.bat` file to trigger test execution seamlessly from command line or CI tool.

## ▶️ How To Run the Project

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Install **Java JDK 21**
- Install **Maven**
- Set environment variables: `JAVA_HOME`, `MAVEN_HOME`, and update `PATH`


Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TestNG-Hybrid-DataDriven-Framework.git

Step 2: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies
cd TestNG-Hybrid-DataDriven-Framework
mvn clean install

Step 3:Run the project using the batch file
run_tests.bat (click on the batch file)

📸 Reports & Logs
📈 HTML Reports generated by Extent Reports after each test run are stored in the reports/ directory, with timestamped folders for each execution.
🪵 Logs are captured using Log4j and saved in the logs/ directory.
📷 Screenshots are automatically taken on test failure to enhance debugging and traceability.
